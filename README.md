# TAQ

TAQ is a new computer language which supports both the declarative and procedural programming
[paradigms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/)
TAQ stands for "Template-Axiom-Query" as it is organized around these 3 elements. 

A query is a declaration that is expressed by combining axioms with templates. An axiom is a structure 
consisting of a sequence of terms which represents a fact. A template is also a structure that unifies 
with axioms that are logically equivalent. Successful unification results an axiom being created by 
the template that is passed to the query solution.

## Java Prerequisite

Familiarity .with the Java programming language is essential in order to proceed. TAQ not only is coded in Java, but borrows heavily
from Java for it's expression syntax. The minimum Java version set for project development is Java SE version 11.


## Getting Started


The instructions for getting started can be found at [TAQ Home Page](https://cybersearch2.com.au/logic/introduction.html).
You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to clone this project from the (
Github site](https://github.com/cybersearch2/taq.git). [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is used to build the project.
Once the project is installed you can progress through the [Reference](https://cybersearch2.com.au/logic/reference.html) while 
running the numerous tutorial examples to learn about the TAQ language.

## TAQ features


here is a lot of borrowing from Java, such as expression syntax and identifiers, but also access to 
components of the Java runtime such as regular expressions and locales. There is a new currency type 
for performing financial calculations and supporting internationalization. There are also special types for
dealing with incomplete, real-world data and the option to have variables without a type unspecified.

The TAQ language is terse, with keywords reserved mostly for structural elements, three of which come from
logic programming,: "axiom", "template" and "term".

Something else to look out for are scopes, which are namespaces which can be assigned individual locales and
properties. Scopes facilitate dealing with categories in which different rules, rates etc apply while
applying local formats in the case of international categories.
